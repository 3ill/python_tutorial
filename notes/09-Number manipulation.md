#### Augmented Assignment Operatior
Augmented assignment operators in Python combine an arithmetic or bitwise operation with an assignment. They offer a shorthand way to modify the value of a variable and reassign the result back to the same variable.

```python
x = 10
x += 3

print(x) #Output: 13
```


>[!important] 
>python has limited inbuilt math methods, to perform more advanced mathematical operations, we can use the `math` module


```python
import math

print(math.ceil(9.52))
```
