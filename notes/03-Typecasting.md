#### What is Typecasting
Typecasting simply put is a way of converting one type to another. There are 4 major types in python
- int
- str
- float 
- bool


```Python
age = 28
gpa = 4.2

print(int(gpa));
print(type(int(gpa)));

print(float(age));
print(type(str(age)))
```

From above, a floating point number is converted to an integer.  the second print statement outputs the type of the variable.

> [!NOTE] INTEGERS
> Integers are whole numbers so the decimal is truncated 


### Falsy values
` ""`
