####  Print statements
There are two main ways to print out statements to the console in python `print("stuffToPrint")` and `print(f"hello {variable}")`

```python
first_name = "Thrill"

print(first_name)
print(f"Hello {first_name}!")
```

The second print statement is used with an `f""` the `f""` is used when you want to concatenate a variable with some strings to print.
